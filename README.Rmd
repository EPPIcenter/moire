`moire` is a package implementing an MCMC based approach to estimating complexity of infection (COI), also sometimes referred to as multiplicity of  infection (MOI), and population allele frequencies from polyallelic genomics data.

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install development version from Github
remotes::install_github("EPPIcenter/moire")
```

## Usage

moire supports loading data from either a long format `data.frame` using `load_long_form_data()` or from a wide format `data.frame` using `load_delimited_data()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
df <- read.csv("your_data.csv")
data <- load_long_form_data(df)

# With data in appropriate format, run MCMC as follows
mcmc_results <- moire::run_mcmc(data, is_missing = data$is_missing)
```
